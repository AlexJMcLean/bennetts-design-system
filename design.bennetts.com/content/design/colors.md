## Principles

### Communication is key

Although we value an aesthetically pleasing use of color, we place a higher value on clear communication. Color supports the purpose of the content, communicating things like hierarchy of information, interactive states, and the difference between distinct elements.

### Colors have meaning

Colors have assigned roles, which hold a specific meaning based on how they function within the interface. Defined color roles make things easy to modify and customize later.

### Colors follow accessibility guidelines

The color system is designed within the HSLuv color space to generate themes that meet WCAG 2.1 compliant contrast ratios. This makes things easier to find, identify, and interact with. It also makes the whole experience more accessible for merchants who are color blind or who have low vision. However you should never convey information using color alone.

## Color roles

We define colors based on the role they play in the interface. There are 10 color roles, which we use to generate the values of all the color variants in the palette.
